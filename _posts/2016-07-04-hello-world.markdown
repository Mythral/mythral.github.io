# Hello World!
Hello Everyone, I just got this site up and running! It's hosted on GitHub Pages using Jekyll! I don't really have a plan of what is going to be posted on this site, but it'll range from programming tips and tricks as well as reviews of tools and services such as Jekyll and Github pages, to information and updates on personal projects. Anyway, this is meant to be a quick introduction and more information will come in the future! 

> Happy Programming Everyone!
