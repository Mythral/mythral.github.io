# What is Jekyll? #

## Introduction ##
In simplest terms, Jekyll is a static file CMS. What this means is that there are no messy databases, no slow dynamic content. 

## Jekyll vs WordPress ## 
WordPress is widely excepted as the best CMS due to its many plugins and themes. However, often times simplicity is the best feature, which is where Jekyll shines. It runs extremely smooth with its barebones installation, however, it is completely customizable and able to do anything that WordPress can, without all the unnecessary clutter. Jekyll is just as themeable as WordPress, the front end can be easily edited, and the content is all stored in static markup files.

## Writing in Jekyll ##
You can write content for your website quickly and easily using either one of the markup languages Jekyll supports. Jekyll supports [Markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) as well as [Textile](http://redcloth.org/textile/). By writing in a markup language you can focus purely on the content of the post, and not worry about formatting it while you write. As a programmer, I love the markup style syntax, it makes it extremely easy to just write and focus on the idea. You can upload your content to your site in a variety of ways. The simplest way to upload your content is to simply place the markup file in the /_posts/ folder of your website, and Jekyll will do the rest. However, if you prefer to do all your work purely online, you can do that as well. Jekyll doesn't have a backend interface where you can write, but there are online tools that can integrate with your Jekyll site to give you the same functionality, without the performance loss. I use and recommend [TinyPress](https://tinypress.co/), which gives you a simple online editor to create and edit your posts. However, if you prefer a WYSIWYG (What you see is what you get) editor, then [Forestry.io](https://forestry.io/) is a really cool new tool.
