# About Me

I am the Founder / Chief Executive Officer for [Mythral Studios](https://mythralstudios.com). I am actively involved in the development of all of our projects.

I'm a developer who primarily specializes in the .NET family, including C# and ASP.NET.

I have also done a large amount of work in the Unity environment.

Aside from the .NET family, I have also done a fair amount of development in HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
